# 02b Pentesting intro: Tutorial on Metasploit

## Recap: Virtual Machine Networking

### (Virtual Box) Networking Options
Explain to your group or shortly write down the explanation for:

**Network Address Translation (NAT)**  
Translator, that translates local IP address to a public internet IP address - or in case of nested subnetting.

**NAT Network**  
A subnet, that also have the ability to communicate with the public internet / parent/adjacent subnet(s).

**Bridge network**  
Using bridge connection, you'll connect directly to a host network card, ignoring OS settings.

**Host only**  
A virtual network interface managed by the host.

### Prepping our Exercise: VM ip address
**Which command would you use to get the IP in Linux?**  
`ip addr`

**Which command would you use to get the IP in Windows?**  
`ipconfig`

**Inspect the whole network configuration of the Linux metasploitable VM, i.e., interfaces, ip addresses, routes.**
