3. What do you learn about SDUâ€™s network? In the protocol, note the IP-range.

The WHOIS information provided by DK-Hostmaster is just regular public information of the registrant, SDU. The WHOIS information provided by RIPE about the IP-address is more detailed and shows relevant information about the Autonomous System number of the ISP and the sub organisation using the ISP's LIC.

4. Are there other Networking-Services @SDU which you could try?

No.

5. What is the whois information for nextcloud.sdu.dk ? What do you observein comparison to the whois-information you gathered for www.sdu.dk.

Subdomains don't have WHOIS records, as they are not meant to be used by a lot other than the registrant of the domain itself. DK-Hostmaster (DK NIC) therefor redirects all *.\<\<domain\>\> to \<\<domain\>\>

## Question: nmap
Nmap scans can be set up to evade firewalls. Which tags would you use for:
* Send packets with specified ip options  
`--ip-options <options>`

* Spoof your MAC address  
`--spoof-mac <mac address>`

## Scanning the Metasploitable VMs
Use Nmap, to scan and find out information about Metasploitable-3, both Windows and Ubuntu. In your use of Nmap compare your SYN scan vs the Connect scan vs the scan with the tag that enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning.

Take notes of the results for all three and discuss differences and pros and cons based on your observation.

**Nmap flags**

| nmap flags | |
|-------|-------|
| SYN scan | `-sS` |
| Connect scan | `-sT` |
| OS and Version Det. | `-O -sV` |
